# Requirements: lucy-ng v3.0 Statistical Detection

**Defined:** 2026-02-10
**Core Value:** AI agent autonomously determines compound structures from NMR, with data-driven statistical constraints replacing guesswork

## v3.0 Requirements

Requirements for v3.0 milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Statistical Detection

- [ ] **DETECT-01**: CLI command detects hybridisation (sp1/sp2/sp3) for a given 13C shift from HOSE database frequency distributions
- [ ] **DETECT-02**: CLI command detects forbidden neighbour atoms (<1% frequency) for a given 13C shift and multiplicity
- [ ] **DETECT-03**: CLI command detects mandatory neighbour atoms (>95% frequency) for a given 13C shift and multiplicity
- [ ] **DETECT-04**: CLI command detects hetero-hetero bond allowance from bond pair statistics (1% threshold)
- [ ] **DETECT-05**: CLI command detects signal grouping (shifts within 0.25 ppm tolerance with matching multiplicities)
- [ ] **DETECT-06**: Database schema extended with hybridisation and neighbour statistics in hose_stats table
- [ ] **DETECT-07**: Statistics generator computes detection statistics during HOSE stats generation

### Ranking & Filtering

- [ ] **RANK-01**: Two-tier ranking scores solutions by signal match count first, then average deviation
- [ ] **RANK-02**: Solutions with fewer matched signals rank lower regardless of MAE
- [ ] **RANK-03**: Badlist filter excludes solutions containing 3-membered rings
- [ ] **RANK-04**: Badlist filter excludes solutions containing 4-membered rings

### Agent Integration

- [ ] **AGENT-01**: CASE agent calls lucy detect CLI commands to generate statistical constraints before writing LSD files
- [ ] **AGENT-02**: CASE agent uses hybridisation detection to set MULT hybridisation values in LSD
- [ ] **AGENT-03**: CASE agent uses neighbourhood detection to add ELIM/LIST constraints in LSD
- [ ] **AGENT-04**: CASE agent uses HHB detection to add or omit hetero-hetero BOND constraints in LSD
- [ ] **AGENT-05**: CASE agent applies chemistry-first hierarchy — NMR knowledge takes priority, statistics augment but don't override
- [ ] **AGENT-06**: CASE agent uses signal grouping detection to identify ambiguous carbon assignments

## Future Requirements

Deferred to later milestones. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Signal Grouping Combinatorial Exchange (v3.1)

- **GROUP-01**: Combinatorial atom exchange for grouped signals (try all permutations)
- **GROUP-02**: Automatic retry with swapped assignments when first attempt yields 0 solutions

### Fragment Library (v3.2)

- **FRAG-02**: Fragment search by shift pattern to suggest substructures
- **FRAG-03**: Fragment constraints integrated into LSD input generation

### Constraint Explorer Specialist (future)

- **CEXP-01**: Specialist agent generates multiple LSD input variants for ambiguous cases
- **CEXP-02**: Runs LSD on all variants in parallel and reports which succeeded

### Solution Explainer Specialist (future)

- **SEXP-01**: Specialist explains WHY a solution ranks #1 vs alternatives
- **SEXP-02**: Comparative report showing constraint satisfaction and shift prediction quality

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Automatic threshold tuning | Sherlock's fixed thresholds work for 82% of cases; override flags sufficient |
| COSY correlation support | Notoriously difficult to analyze, deferred indefinitely |
| Real-time statistics computation | Pre-computed during DB build; no runtime queries against raw HOSE data |
| GUI for detection results | CLI-only architecture; AI agent consumes JSON output |
| Custom HOSE radius for detection | Default radius sufficient; configurable radius adds complexity without clear benefit |
| Stereochemistry handling (E/Z, R/S) | Requires different NMR experiments, out of scope |
| CLI command for sanitisation | Anti-feature: requires AI reasoning |
| Dereplication in CASE orchestrator | Anti-feature: absolute separation |
