# lucy-ng State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-08)

**Core value:** AI agent autonomously determines compound structures from NMR, with multi-agent architecture preventing loops
**Current focus:** v2.1 Working Multi-Agent CASE — sub-command skills, real agent orchestration, validation-first development

## Current Position

**Milestone**: v2.1 Working Multi-Agent CASE
**Phase**: Phase 33 (Documentation and Cleanup) — IN PROGRESS
**Plan**: 33-01 complete (CLAUDE.md updates, v2.1 release notes)
**Status**: Phase in progress — 1 of 3 plans complete
**Last activity**: 2026-02-09 — Completed 33-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [██████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 86% (6/7 phases, 1/3 plans in Phase 33)

## Completed Milestones

| Milestone | Phases | Shipped |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| v1.0 Core CASE Pipeline | 1-10 | 2026-01-12 |
| v1.1 Database-Backed Dereplication | 11-15 | 2026-01-15 |
| v1.2 HOSE Database Prediction | 16-19 | 2026-01-18 |
| v2.0 Robust Multi-Agent CASE | 20-26 | 2026-02-08 |

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 38 (v1.0-v2.1)
- Average duration: ~3 hours per phase (v1.0-v1.2), < 15 min per phase (v2.0-v2.1 docs/skills), ~3 min per plan (v2.1 implementation)
- Total execution time: ~64.82 hours

**v2.1 Roadmap:**
- 7 phases defined (27-33)
- 30 requirements mapped
- 100% requirement coverage validated

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v2.1: GSD-pattern sub-commands — skills as ~/.claude/commands/lucy-ng/*.md
- v2.1: /lucy-ng:case NEVER attempts dereplication — absolute separation
- v2.1: Sanitisation is AI-only — no CLI, requires AI reasoning to identify compound identifiers
- v2.1: Sanitise skill must explicitly state there is no CLI for this purpose
- v2.1: Option A for CASE supervision — autonomous CASE agent, orchestrator handles failure
- v2.1: Supervisor logic dissolves into case.md orchestrator skill (not a separate agent)
- v2.1: Old monolithic /lucy-ng skill replaced by sub-commands
- v2.1: Validation-first development — prove Task() spawning works before expanding skills
- v2.1: Hybrid context inlining — 500-700 lines critical content inlined, detailed references via file paths
- v2.1: Per-pattern intervention counters — track failures separately, 10-cycle escalation per pattern
- v2.1: Advisory interventions say WHAT not HOW — preserves agent autonomy
- v2.1: Batch monitoring over synchronous — spawn once for ~10 iterations, read progress after batch
- Phase 28: Agent files live in ~/.claude/agents/ (user-global, not project-specific)
- Phase 28: CASE-PROGRESS.md append-only format for supervisor monitoring
- Phase 29: Orchestrator skill dissolves v2.0 supervisor.md logic into case.md sub-command
- Phase 30: Diagnostic specialist delegation after 2 failed basic interventions (threshold = 2)
- Phase 30: Specialist-informed advisory extracts specific fix from DIAGNOSTIC-REPORT.md
- Phase 30: Fallback to basic advisory if DIAGNOSTIC-REPORT.md missing after delegation
- Phase 31: Pure AI sanitisation workflow (no CLI, no scripts)
- Phase 31: [REDACTED] replacement string for all identifier redactions
- Phase 31: Full re-scan verification (second pass confirms completeness)
- Phase 32: Pre-flight checks before validation guide creation (document actual readiness)
- Phase 32: Exact paths in test instructions (no placeholders for copy-paste ease)
- Phase 32: 7 known failure modes documented with symptoms, causes, fixes
- Phase 33: CLAUDE.md points to sub-commands as entry points, not skill/SKILL.md
- Phase 33: Document actual agent filenames (lucy-case-agent.md, lucy-diagnostic.md) not vague language
- Phase 33: v2.1 release notes capture working orchestration vs v2.0 paper architecture

### Pending Todos

- Execute validation tests per 32-VALIDATION-GUIDE.md (user action)
- Prove Task() spawning works with autonomous CASE agent (Phase 32 user test)
- Complete Phase 33 (cleanup) after validation passes

### Blockers/Concerns

- v2.0 multi-agent architecture exists only on paper — agents defined but never invoked
- Critical risk: Repeating v2.0's paper architecture mistake (mitigation: validation gates in every phase)
- Virgiline (CASE7) failure is the motivating case — working multi-agent should address root causes
- Task tool model parameter bug (#18873) — use `model: inherit` workaround
