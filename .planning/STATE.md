## Current Position

**Milestone**: 1.0 — Core CASE Pipeline
**Phase**: 2.1 (1D Carbon Dereplication) — Complete
**Status**: Ready for Phase 3

## Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 2.1 inserted after Phase 2: 1D Carbon Dereplication with nmrshiftdb (INSERTED)
  - Rationale: Validate pipeline works with 1D data before adding 2D complexity

## Recent Progress

- Phase 2.1 1D Carbon Dereplication complete (6 commits)
- NMRShiftDBLoader for parsing reference SD file with DEPT info
- SimplePeakPicker with threshold-based detection
- SpectrumMatcher with multi-mode matching and fuzzy tolerances
- DereplicationService with three entry points
- 18 comprehensive tests

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Date | Context |
|----------|------|---------|
| Hybrid CLI + MCP interface | 2026-01-08 | MCP for agent iteration, CLI for testing |
| Bruker-only for v1 | 2026-01-08 | Focus on most common format |
| LSD/pyLSD as primary solvers | 2026-01-08 | Established CASE tools with CLI |
| nmrglue for NMR parsing | 2026-01-08 | Most mature, BSD licensed, native Bruker support |
| Pydantic v2 for models | 2026-01-08 | Type safety, validation, JSON serialization |
| hatch build system | 2026-01-08 | Modern Python packaging |
| Use processed data | 2026-01-08 | Read from pdata/1/ not raw FID |
| Multi-mode dereplication matching | 2026-01-09 | shifts_only, dept_enhanced modes for different data quality |
| Overlap-adjusted scoring | 2026-01-09 | Account for fewer peaks than expected carbons |
| Variable tolerance by region | 2026-01-09 | Tighter for aliphatic (0.8), looser for carbonyl (1.5) |
| RDKit for SD parsing | 2026-01-09 | Industry standard, handles MOL blocks and properties |

## Open Questions

- LSD vs pyLSD - which to target first?

## Resolved Questions

- **NMR parsing library**: nmrglue (2026-01-08) — Most mature, BSD licensed, native Bruker support, academic citations
- **Dereplication matching strategy**: Multi-mode with fuzzy tolerances (2026-01-09)

## Session Continuity

**Last session**: 2026-01-09
**Completed**: Phase 2.1 1D Carbon Dereplication (01-02.1-PLAN.md executed)
**Next**: Phase 3 2D NMR Reading
