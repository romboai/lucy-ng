# lucy-ng State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** AI agent autonomously determines compound structures from NMR, with a collaborative team architecture that self-corrects through peer review
**Current focus:** v6.0 Skill Quality Overhaul — Phase 55: Skill Architecture

## Current Position

Phase: 55 of 58 (Skill Architecture)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-10 — v6.0 roadmap created, ready to plan Phase 55

Progress: [██████████] 98%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 100 across 8 milestones
- v5.0: 6 phases, 12 plans, 47 commits, 3 days
- Cumulative: 54 phases, 100 plans, 8 milestones in 44 days

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
- [Phase 55-skill-architecture]: Deprecated lucy-case-agent.md via blockquote header to preserve history while clearly marking retirement
- [Phase 55-skill-architecture]: Created shared nmr-basics.md as canonical reference for NMR experiment types and shift regions
- [Phase 55-skill-architecture]: Read-file directive pattern: agents reference shared files rather than duplicating tables

### Pending Todos

- Statistical 4J HMBC coupling detection (highest priority — deferred to future milestone)
- Multi-compound UAT with non-aromatic compounds
- COSY correlation integration
- NP-likeness scoring

### Blockers/Concerns

- 4J HMBC couplings silently exclude correct structures — all 6 local test compounds affected (not blocking v6.0, deferred)
- v6.0 smoke test (OPER-02) requires a minimal test NMR dataset at data/test/minimal/

### Strategic Reference

See `background/sherlock-analysis.md` for full Sherlock vs lucy-ng comparison. Fragment library now built (2.4M SSCs). Remaining gap: statistical 4J coupling detection.
