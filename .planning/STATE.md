# lucy-ng State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** AI agent autonomously determines compound structures from NMR, with a collaborative team architecture that self-corrects through peer review
**Current focus:** Between milestones — run /gsd:new-milestone

## Current Position

Phase: All 58 phases complete
Status: Between milestones
Last activity: 2026-03-10 — v6.0 Skill Quality Overhaul shipped

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Completed Milestones

| Milestone | Phases | Shipped |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| v1.0 Core CASE Pipeline | 1-10 | 2026-01-12 |
| v1.1 Database-Backed Dereplication | 11-15 | 2026-01-15 |
| v1.2 HOSE Database Prediction | 16-19 | 2026-01-18 |
| v2.0 Robust Multi-Agent CASE | 20-26 | 2026-02-08 |
| v2.1 Working Multi-Agent CASE | 27-33 | 2026-02-09 |
| v3.0 Statistical Detection | 34-40 | 2026-02-16 |
| v4.0 Team-Based CASE | 41-48 | 2026-02-18 |
| v5.0 Fragment Library | 49-54 | 2026-02-21 |
| v6.0 Skill Quality Overhaul | 55-58 | 2026-03-10 |

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 107 across 9 milestones
- v6.0: 4 phases, 7 plans, 20 commits, 1 day
- Cumulative: 58 phases, 107 plans, 9 milestones in 62 days

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

### Pending Todos

- Statistical 4J HMBC coupling detection (highest priority — deferred to future milestone)
- Multi-compound UAT with non-aromatic compounds
- COSY correlation integration
- NP-likeness scoring

### Blockers/Concerns

- 4J HMBC couplings through aromatic rings — heuristic flagging added in v6.0, statistical detection still needed

### Strategic Reference

See `background/sherlock-analysis.md` for full Sherlock vs lucy-ng comparison. Fragment library built (2.4M SSCs). Remaining gap: statistical 4J coupling detection.
