## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-06)

**Core value:** AI agent autonomously determines compound structures from NMR, with multi-agent architecture preventing loops
**Current focus:** Phase 20 - System Audit

## Current Position

**Milestone**: v2.0 Robust Multi-Agent CASE
**Phase**: 20 of 26 (System Audit)
**Plan**: 2 of 3 in current phase
**Status**: In progress
**Last activity**: 2026-02-06 -- Completed 20-02-PLAN.md (CLAUDE.md audit)

Progress: [===================|..........] 66% (19/26 phases complete overall)

## Completed Milestones

| Milestone | Phases | Shipped |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| v1.0 Core CASE Pipeline | 1-10 | 2026-01-12 |
| v1.1 Database-Backed Dereplication | 11-15 | 2026-01-15 |
| v1.2 HOSE Database Prediction | 16-19 | 2026-01-18 |

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 19 (v1.0-v1.2)
- Average duration: ~3 hours per phase
- Total execution time: ~60 hours

**Recent Trend:**
- v1.2 phases completed rapidly (3 days for 4 phases)
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v2.0: AI as intelligence layer -- domain knowledge in skill, not Python code
- v2.0: Multi-agent CASE -- supervisor prevents loops, specialists handle subtasks
- v2.0: Error tolerance as skill knowledge -- teach AI to detect issues, not build Python machinery
- v2.0: Skip COSY -- notoriously difficult to analyze, defer

### Pending Todos

- 20-02 audit found CLAUDE.md is 80% domain knowledge (~590 lines) that should move to SKILL.md in Phase 21

### Blockers/Concerns

- Virgiline (CASE7) failure is the motivating case for v2.0 -- supervisor and incremental HMBC should address root causes
