## Current Position

**Milestone**: 1.0 — Core CASE Pipeline
**Phase**: 9 (LSD Solution Ranking) — NOT STARTED
**Last Completed**: Phase 8 (HOSE-Based 13C Predictor)

## Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 2.1 inserted after Phase 2: 1D Carbon Dereplication with nmrshiftdb (INSERTED)
  - Rationale: Validate pipeline works with 1D data before adding 2D complexity
- Phase 4.1 inserted after Phase 4: 2D Peak Picking Validation (INSERTED)
  - Rationale: Ensure 2D peak picking produces scientifically reasonable results
- Phase 4.2 inserted after Phase 4.1: DEPT-Guided Adaptive HSQC Peak Picking (INSERTED)
  - Rationale: DEPT provides ground truth for protonated carbons; HSQC must find all of them
- Phase 5.1 added: HMBC-Guided Peak Picking (COMPLETE)
  - Rationale: Filter HMBC noise by requiring correlation to known C and H positions
- Phase 5.2 inserted after Phase 5.1: Symmetry Detection from Spectroscopic Data (INSERTED)
  - Rationale: Molecular symmetry causes fewer NMR signals than atoms; must detect and handle for valid LSD input
- Phase 8 added: HOSE-Based 13C Predictor (ADDED)
  - Rationale: Build pure Python 13C predictor using HOSE codes; evaluated GNN tools (nmrgnn, CASCADE, nmr_mpnn) but all had TensorFlow compatibility issues
- Phase 9 added: LSD Solution Ranking (RENUMBERED from Phase 8)
  - Rationale: Use Phase 8 predictor to rank LSD solutions by spectrum similarity

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Date | Context |
|----------|------|---------|

| Overlap-adjusted scoring | 2026-01-09 | Account for fewer peaks than expected carbons |
| Variable tolerance by region | 2026-01-09 | Tighter for aliphatic (0.8), looser for carbonyl (1.5) |

| inv4* long-range detection | 2026-01-10 | Distinguish HMBC from HSQC in inv4 pulse programs |
| nmrglue connected-region algorithm | 2026-01-10 | For 2D peak picking, handles overlapping peaks |
| Corner-based 2D noise estimation | 2026-01-10 | Corners rarely contain real peaks |
| Tolerance-based peak validation | 2026-01-10 | 0.5-1.0 ppm tolerance for 2D vs 1D matching |
| DEPT-guided adaptive thresholding | 2026-01-10 | Lower HSQC threshold until all DEPT carbons matched |
| Multiplicative threshold reduction | 2026-01-10 | ×0.5 factor gives logarithmic steps |
| HMBC-guided peak picking | 2026-01-10 | Filter HMBC by requiring C match in 13C/DEPT and H match in HSQC |
| LSD 2-param HMBC format | 2026-01-10 | LSD defaults to 2-3 bond distance; simpler than 4-param format |
| Real data over manual correlations | 2026-01-10 | Manual test correlations produced 900+ solutions; real data provides stronger constraints |
| Spectroscopic constraint inference | 2026-01-10 | Carbonyl C identified from shift; missing H assigned to O; derives BOND constraints automatically |
| Click CLI framework | 2026-01-10 | Simpler than Typer, no extra dependencies, widely used |
| JSON output option | 2026-01-10 | Enables MCP server reuse of CLI functionality |

## Open Questions

- None at this time

## Resolved Questions

- **NMR parsing library**: nmrglue (2026-01-08) — Most mature, BSD licensed, native Bruker support, academic citations
- **Dereplication matching strategy**: Multi-mode with fuzzy tolerances (2026-01-09)
- **LSD vs pyLSD**: LSD first (2026-01-10) — Simpler (no Java), pyLSD builds on it, add ranking later
- **Symmetry detection**: (2026-01-10) — AI-driven approach with convenience tools exposing H budget + intensity data

## Session Continuity

**Last session**: 2026-01-11
**Completed**:
- **Phase 8 HOSE-Based 13C Predictor complete**
- Pure Python predictor using HOSE codes + COCONUT database
- New `lucy_ng.prediction` module:
  - `HOSECodeGenerator`: HOSE code generation wrapper
  - `HOSELookupTable`: Build/save/load lookup tables
  - `C13Predictor`: Predict shifts with 6→1 radius fallback
- CLI commands: `lucy predict c13`, `lucy predict build-table`, `lucy predict table-info`
- MCP tool: `predict_c13_shifts`
- 28 new tests (all passing)
- Added hosegen and tqdm dependencies

**Previous session**:
- Phase 7 MCP Server complete (11 tools total now)
- 347+ total tests collected

**Key technical insights**:
- HOSE codes work with RDKit only (no TensorFlow needed)
- GNN tools (nmrgnn, CASCADE, nmr_mpnn) all had TF compatibility issues
- 6-sphere HOSE radius provides good specificity with fallback safety
- Lookup table expected size: 1-2GB compressed for full COCONUT

**Next**: Phase 9 - Use predictor for LSD solution ranking
