# lucy-ng State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-19)

**Core value:** AI agent autonomously determines compound structures from NMR, with a collaborative team architecture that self-corrects through peer review
**Current focus:** v5.0 Fragment Library — Phase 49 Plans 01-02 complete; Phase 50 ready to execute

## Current Position

**Milestone**: v5.0 Fragment Library
**Phase**: 50 of 54 (SSC Extraction Pipeline)
**Status**: Ready to plan
**Last activity**: 2026-02-19 — Phase 49 Plan 02 executed: lucy fragment CLI command group with info subcommand

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20% (2 plans complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 88 across 7 milestones (+ 1 in v5.0)
- v4.0: 9 phases, 21 plans, 48 commits, 2 days
- v5.0: 1 plan, 2 commits, 3 min
- Total execution time: ~78.2 hours + 3 min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions affecting v5.0:
- Separate `lucy-ng-fragments.db` file (not merged into 2.8 GB main DB) — Dropbox sync and index contention
- Validate 2 ppm bin size on 1K sample BEFORE full 24M extraction — bin size is unrecoverable once baked in
- DEFF goodlist LSD syntax requires LSD smoke test validation BEFORE agent integration — goodlist vs DEFF NOT semantic confusion is silent failure
- Phases 51 and 52 can run in parallel — both depend only on SSCMatch model from Phase 49, not on Phase 50 data
- Phase 49: fragments/ module fully independent from database/ (zero cross-imports), INSERT OR IGNORE for bin_size protects existing populated DBs
- Phase 49 Plan 02: existence check (db_path.exists()) before FragmentDatabaseManager open prevents sqlite3 silent empty-file creation

### Pending Todos

- Statistical 4J HMBC coupling detection (deferred to v5.1)
- Multi-compound UAT (pulegone, virgiline, etc.)
- COSY correlation integration (deferred to v5.2)
- NP-likeness scoring (deferred to v5.2)

### Blockers/Concerns

- 4J HMBC couplings silently exclude correct structures — deferred to v5.1; v5.0 UAT should test non-4J compounds first
- SSC extraction runtime: projected 4-8 hours; checkpointing is mandatory before full run

### Strategic Reference

See `background/sherlock-analysis.md` for full Sherlock vs lucy-ng comparison. Fragment library is the last remaining major gap for Sherlock parity.
