## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-16)

**Core value:** AI agent autonomously determines compound structures from NMR, with a collaborative team architecture that self-corrects through peer review
**Current focus:** v4.0 Team-Based CASE — Phase 43 in progress

## Current Position

**Milestone**: v4.0 Team-Based CASE — Phases 41-47
**Phase**: 44 — CASE-PROGRESS.md Format (in progress)
**Plan**: 44-02 complete (write_progress step added to case.md, spawn prompts updated)
**Status**: Phase 44 executing — 44-01 (agent updates) and 44-02 (orchestrator write_progress) done
**Last activity**: 2026-02-17 — 44-02 complete (write_progress step with 9 triggers, coordinator-as-sole-writer protocol enforced)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 73 across 6 milestones (+ 8 in v4.0)
- v3.0: 7 phases, 21 plans, 51 commits, 2 days
- Total execution time: ~78.2 hours

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

### Pending Todos

- Post-phase UAT with additional compounds (pulegone, etc.)

### Blockers/Concerns

- Agent behavior gaps from v3.0 UAT: DEFF NOT persistence, signal grouping not applied, grouped notation lost (v4.0 target)
- COSY agent usage: deferred beyond v4.0
- Database regeneration: End users with pre-v3.0 databases must regenerate

## Accumulated Decisions (Phase 44)

- **44-02:** write_progress is a REFERENCE step (not sequential) — coordinator writes throughout workflow as messages arrive
- **44-02:** 9 writing triggers defined covering all agent message types: file header, [SETUP-COMPLETE], iteration header, [ITERATION-COMPLETE], [VALIDATION-PASSED]/[VALIDATION-BLOCKED], coordinator solution count, [RANKING-COMPLETE], diagnostic intervention, intra-iteration revision
- **44-02:** devils-advocate prompt changed from monitoring CASE-PROGRESS.md to receiving validation requests via SendMessage — aligns with its read-only tool access
- **44-02:** All field names preserved identically to v3.0 (Solution count, Constraints added, sp2 count, H budget, HMBC correlations used) — LLM parsing handles deeper nesting transparently

## Accumulated Decisions (Phase 43)

- **43-01:** JSON format confirmed safe in LSD ; comments (parser smoke test passed); inventory block at TOP of LSD file before MULT definitions
- **43-01:** deff_not_patterns initialized at iteration 1 alongside DEFF NOT commands (atomic write rule prevents desync)
- **43-01:** NEVER rebuild inventory from scratch -- same read-previous-never-reconstruct rule applied to inventory itself
- **43-02:** Three-check inventory reconciliation (accuracy, regression, content) is the primary validation protocol for Devils-Advocate
- **43-02:** Legacy fallback for files without inventory block -- backwards compatible with pre-Phase-43 LSD files
- **43-02:** Detection coverage check at 3+ iterations triggers WARNING for pending_from_detection items
