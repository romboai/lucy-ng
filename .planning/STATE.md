## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v3.0: Major version bump — statistical detection is fundamental capability addition, not incremental
- v3.0: Motivated by Sherlock CASE system analysis (Wenk PhD thesis) — identified 5 critical gaps
- v3.0: Gap 1 (statistical detection) selected as first milestone — universal benefit, builds on existing HOSE DB
- v3.0: Gaps 4+5 (ranking + badlist) bundled into v3.0 — too small for standalone milestones
- v3.0: Signal grouping detection included — identifies close shifts but combinatorial exchange deferred to v3.1
- Phase 34-01: Use ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN for v3→v4 migration (safe, fast, in-place)
- Phase 34-01: Composite index (radius, mean) for O(log N) BETWEEN queries in detection
- Phase 34-01: All query methods backward compatible with v3 databases (try/except fallback)
- Phase 34-02: extract_hybridisation() at module level for reusability across generator classes
- Phase 34-02: update_with_hybridisation() instead of modifying update() for backward compatibility
- Phase 34-02: generate_all() returns tuple (aggregates, hybridisations) - minimal breaking change
- Phase 34-02: Treat S and UNSPECIFIED hybridisations as sp3 (conservative default)
- Phase 34-03: StatisticalDetector is pure query+frequency layer (no HOSE/RDKit logic)
- Phase 35-01: Neighbour count columns store presence frequency (count of observations with ≥1 element)
- Phase 35-01: Halogen aggregation in single has_halogen_neighbor column (F/Cl/Br/I combined)
- Phase 35-01: parse_sphere_1() uses regex [A-Z][a-z]? to extract elements, ignoring bond prefixes
- Phase 35-01: Upsert accepts 5, 8, or 13-element tuples for v3/v4/v5 backward compatibility
- Phase 35-02: update_with_neighbors() calls update_with_hybridisation() internally for composition
- Phase 35-02: WelfordAccumulator.to_tuple() extended from 6 to 11 elements for v5 schema
- Phase 35-02: HOSEStatsGenerator.generate_all() returns 3-tuple (aggregates, hybridisations, neighbour_counts)
- Phase 35-03: mandatory_elements/forbidden_elements properties use hardcoded 0.95/0.01 thresholds for convenience
- Phase 35-03: Constraints use custom thresholds passed to detect_neighbours() for flexibility
- Phase 35-03: Warn on unpopulated neighbour columns (v4 databases) rather than fail
- Phase 35-04: --mode flag overrides --min-frequency/--max-frequency when both provided
- Phase 35-04: No multiplicity argument for neighbours detection (research recommends ignoring it)
- Phase 36-01: Bond pair statistics at formula level (not HOSE level) - correct granularity for HHB queries
- Phase 36-01: Ring columns store counts (not booleans) for frequency distributions
- Phase 36-01: Composite PRIMARY KEY (formula_normalized, element1, element2) for bond_pair_stats
- Phase 36-01: Backward compatibility - get_bond_pair_stats_by_formula returns [] for v5 databases
- Phase 36-02: update_with_rings() calls update_with_neighbors() internally for composition pattern
- Phase 36-02: WelfordAccumulator.to_tuple() extended from 11 to 14 elements for v6 schema
- Phase 36-02: extract_hetero_hetero_bonds() returns canonicalized pairs (alphabetically sorted)
- Phase 36-02: HOSEStatsGenerator.generate_all() returns 4-tuple adding ring_counts dict
- Phase 36-03: Heteroatom detection via simple regex pattern (no RDKit needed for formula parsing)
- Phase 36-03: Pure hydrocarbons get has_heteroatoms=False with clear user message
- Phase 36-03: CLI takes FORMULA argument (not shift_ppm) to distinguish from other detect subcommands
- Phase 36-03: Formula not in database returns has_data=False with warning (vs formula exists but no HHB)
- Phase 37-01: Complete linkage prevents chaining (all pairwise distances must be <= tolerance)
- Phase 37-01: Multiplicity incompatible pairs cause entire group to split into singletons
- Phase 37-01: Ambiguous multiplicities (CH/CH3) do NOT bridge incompatible pairs (CH vs CH3)
- Phase 37-01: Use statistics.mean() instead of numpy to avoid adding dependency for trivial math
- Phase 37-01: 1-based LSD atom IDs with parenthesized format for multi-atom groups
- Phase 37-02: Use actual LSD runs instead of syntax mocking for validation (stronger validation)
- Phase 37-02: Count solutions via .sol file detection (more reliable than stderr parsing)
- Phase 37-02: Document false positive risk and tolerance rationale as test docstrings
- Phase 37-03: Custom text formatting instead of GroupingResult.summary() for LSD atom list display
- Phase 37-03: Lazy import of group_signals() following detect.py pattern
- Phase 37-03: False positive warning mandatory in text output
- Phase 38-02: 8 DEFF NOT patterns exclude all common strained ring motifs (3- and 4-membered)
- Phase 38-02: Epoxide exception documented with specific shift range (45-55 ppm) and formula requirements
- Phase 38-02: Two-tier ranking prioritizes signal match count over MAE to prevent wrong structures with coincidentally low errors

### Pending Todos

- ~~Implement neighbourhood detection CLI commands (Phase 35)~~ → COMPLETE
- ~~Implement HHB and ring detection (Phase 36)~~ → COMPLETE
- ~~Signal grouping detection (Phase 37)~~ → COMPLETE
- ~~Two-tier ranking implementation (Phase 38-01)~~ → COMPLETE
- ~~Badlist documentation and ranking guidance (Phase 38-02)~~ → COMPLETE
- Update CASE agent to use new CLI commands for constraint generation (Phase 39)
- Validate on ibuprofen (Phase 40) — must find correct aromatic structure

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~HOSE database schema extension requires migration or fresh generation~~ → RESOLVED: ALTER TABLE migration is instant
- HOSE database hybridisation columns exist but are unpopulated (all 0) until database regeneration (v4→v5 migration adds neighbour columns with DEFAULT 0)
- Database regeneration required: After stats generator update (35-02), full regeneration needed to populate neighbour counts
- Ibuprofen failure root cause: 4-bond HMBC + rigid assignment + no statistical constraints → cyclohexadiene solutions
- ~~Research flags threshold sensitivity~~ → RESOLVED: --mode relaxed and --min/max-frequency override flags implemented in Phase 35-04
