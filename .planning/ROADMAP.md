# lucy-ng Roadmap

## Milestone 1.0 — Core CASE Pipeline

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Goal**: Project structure, dependencies, and NMR library evaluation

- Set up Python package structure with modern tooling (pyproject.toml)
- Research and evaluate NMR parsing libraries (nmrglue, bruker-reader, etc.)
- Establish core data models for spectra and peaks
- Basic test infrastructure

**Research**: NMR parsing library selection

---

### Phase 2: 1D NMR Reading
**Goal**: Read Bruker 1D spectra (1H, 13C) reliably

- Implement Bruker 1D file reader (fid, acqus, procs)
- Parse acquisition and processing parameters
- Handle spectrum data (real/imaginary, processed)
- Data structures for 1D spectra with metadata

---

### Phase 2.1: 1D Carbon Dereplication (INSERTED)
**Goal**: Validate pipeline with 1D dereplication against nmrshiftdb

- Peak picking from 1D 13C spectrum
- Download/query reference data from nmrshiftdb by molecular formula
- Match observed peaks against reference spectra
- Score and rank candidate structures
- Return dereplication results (match/no match/candidates)

**Depends on:** Phase 2
**Research**: nmrshiftdb API/data format, matching algorithms

---

### Phase 3: 2D NMR Reading
**Goal**: Read Bruker 2D spectra (HSQC, HMBC)

- Implement Bruker 2D file reader (ser, acqu2s)
- Parse 2D acquisition parameters (F1/F2 dimensions)
- Handle 2D data matrices
- Data structures for 2D spectra with correlation information

---

### Phase 4: Peak Picking
**Goal**: Automated peak detection for 1D and 2D spectra

- 1D peak picking algorithm (threshold, noise estimation)
- 2D peak picking (local maxima, cross-peak detection)
- Peak list data structures
- Peak filtering and validation

**Research**: Peak picking algorithms and thresholds

---

### Phase 5: LSD Integration
**Goal**: Generate input files and execute LSD/pyLSD solvers

- Research LSD/pyLSD input file format
- Generate constraint files from peak data
- Execute LSD/pyLSD as subprocess
- Parse and structure solution output

**Research**: LSD/pyLSD file formats and CLI interface

---

### Phase 6: CLI Interface
**Goal**: Command-line interface for all operations

- CLI framework setup (click or typer)
- Commands for reading spectra
- Commands for peak picking
- Commands for LSD execution
- Workflow commands (full pipeline)

---

### Phase 7: MCP Server
**Goal**: Model Context Protocol tools for Claude agent integration

- MCP server setup
- Tool definitions for all operations
- Structured input/output schemas
- Agent-friendly error handling and feedback
