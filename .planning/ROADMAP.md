<summary>v1.0 Core CASE Pipeline (Phases 1-10) - COMPLETE 2026-01-12</summary>

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Goal**: Project structure, dependencies, and NMR library evaluation

- Set up Python package structure with modern tooling (pyproject.toml)
- Research and evaluate NMR parsing libraries (nmrglue, bruker-reader, etc.)
- Establish core data models for spectra and peaks
- Basic test infrastructure

**Research**: NMR parsing library selection

---

### Phase 2: 1D NMR Reading
**Goal**: Read Bruker 1D spectra (1H, 13C) reliably

- Implement Bruker 1D file reader (fid, acqus, procs)
- Parse acquisition and processing parameters
- Handle spectrum data (real/imaginary, processed)
- Data structures for 1D spectra with metadata

---

### Phase 2.1: 1D Carbon Dereplication (INSERTED)
**Goal**: Validate pipeline with 1D dereplication against nmrshiftdb

- Peak picking from 1D 13C spectrum
- Download/query reference data from nmrshiftdb by molecular formula
- Match observed peaks against reference spectra
- Score and rank candidate structures
- Return dereplication results (match/no match/candidates)

**Depends on:** Phase 2
**Research**: nmrshiftdb API/data format, matching algorithms

---

### Phase 3: 2D NMR Reading
**Goal**: Read Bruker 2D spectra (HSQC, HMBC)

- Implement Bruker 2D file reader (ser, acqu2s)
- Parse 2D acquisition parameters (F1/F2 dimensions)
- Handle 2D data matrices
- Data structures for 2D spectra with correlation information

---

### Phase 4: Peak Picking
**Goal**: Automated peak detection for 1D and 2D spectra

- 1D peak picking algorithm (threshold, noise estimation)
- 2D peak picking (local maxima, cross-peak detection)
- Peak list data structures
- Peak filtering and validation

**Research**: Peak picking algorithms and thresholds

---

### Phase 4.1: 2D Peak Picking Validation (INSERTED)
**Goal**: Validate that 2D peak picking produces scientifically reasonable results

- Cross-validate HSQC peaks against 1D 13C peaks
- Every HSQC F1 position should correspond to a 1D 13C peak
- Develop validation utility for peak list quality assurance
- Tolerance-based matching between 2D F1 and 1D peak positions

**Depends on:** Phase 4
**Rationale**: Ensure 2D peak picking is physically plausible before using peaks for structure elucidation

---

### Phase 4.2: DEPT-Guided Adaptive HSQC Peak Picking (INSERTED)
**Goal**: Use DEPT data as ground truth to adaptively tune HSQC peak picking

- Read DEPT-135 spectrum to identify all protonated carbons
- Use DEPT peaks as validation targets for HSQC
- Adaptively lower HSQC threshold until all DEPT carbons are matched
- Filter HSQC peaks to only those corresponding to real carbons
- Return validated, noise-free HSQC peak list

**Depends on:** Phase 4.1
**Rationale**: DEPT provides definitive ground truth for which carbons carry hydrogens; HSQC must find all of them

---

### Phase 5: LSD Integration
**Goal**: Generate input files and execute LSD/pyLSD solvers

- Research LSD/pyLSD input file format
- Generate constraint files from peak data
- Execute LSD/pyLSD as subprocess
- Parse and structure solution output

**Research**: LSD/pyLSD file formats and CLI interface

---

### Phase 5.1: HMBC-Guided Peak Picking (INSERTED)
**Goal**: Filter HMBC peaks using validated carbon and proton positions

- Use 13C/DEPT peaks as valid carbon positions
- Use HSQC proton positions as valid proton positions
- Filter HMBC to only peaks matching both constraints
- Reduce noise and improve LSD constraint quality

**Depends on:** Phase 5
**Rationale**: HMBC noise produces spurious correlations; filtering by known positions improves LSD results

---

### Phase 5.2: Symmetry Detection from Spectroscopic Data (INSERTED)
**Goal**: Detect molecular symmetry to properly handle equivalent atoms in LSD input

- Hydrogen counting: Compare MF hydrogen count with carbon-assigned H sum
- Detect "missing" hydrogens indicating equivalent carbons
- Intensity analysis: Identify doubled signals from relative peak intensities
- Pattern recognition: Recognize symmetric motifs (para-substituted benzene, isopropyl, etc.)
- Generate proper atom definitions for equivalent positions
- Support LSD SYME commands for equivalent atom constraints

**Depends on:** Phase 5.1
**Rationale**: Molecular symmetry causes fewer NMR signals than atoms; without handling this, LSD fails with valence errors

---

### Phase 6: CLI Interface
**Goal**: Command-line interface for all operations

- CLI framework setup (click or typer)
- Commands for reading spectra
- Commands for peak picking
- Commands for LSD execution
- Workflow commands (full pipeline)

- Predictor class with fallback to shorter HOSE radii
- Confidence scoring based on match count and variance
- CLI command for shift prediction
- MCP tool for agent integration

**Research**: Completed - evaluated nmrgnn, CASCADE, nmr_mpnn (all had dependency issues); HOSE codes selected

---

### Phase 9: LSD Solution Ranking
**Goal**: Rank LSD solutions by similarity between experimental 13C spectrum and predicted spectrum

- Use Phase 8 predictor for candidate structure shifts
- Compare predicted shifts with experimental 13C peaks
- Score solutions by spectrum similarity (e.g., MAE, RMSE, or cosine similarity)
- Rank and filter solutions by prediction quality
- Return ranked solution list with confidence scores

**Depends on:** Phase 8 (HOSE Predictor)

---

### Phase 10: NMRXiv Dataset Fetching

<summary>v2.0 Robust Multi-Agent CASE (Phases 20-26) -- SHIPPED 2026-02-08</summary>

**Milestone Goal:** Transform lucy-ng from a tool-heavy system into an AI-first skill with thin tool wrappers and a multi-agent architecture that prevents unproductive loops during structure elucidation.

**Three pillars:**
1. Audit and Simplify -- examine every component, classify intelligence for migration
2. Skill Rewrite -- incremental HMBC strategy, error tolerance as AI knowledge, spectral quality assessment
3. Multi-Agent Architecture -- supervisor + CASE agent + diagnostic specialist; supervisor detects loops and redirects

**Phase overview:**

- [x] **Phase 20: System Audit** -- COMPLETE 2026-02-06. 15 MCP tools, 9 CLI groups, 1,080-line CLAUDE.md classified
- [x] **Phase 21: Skill Restructure** -- COMPLETE 2026-02-06. CLAUDE.md 305 lines, SKILL.md 418 lines, SUPERVISOR.md 78 lines, zero duplication
- [x] **Phase 22: HMBC Strategy and Spectral Quality** -- COMPLETE 2026-02-06. SKILL.md 610 lines (+192), spectral quality + incremental HMBC strategy
- [x] **Phase 23: Error Tolerance and Confidence** -- COMPLETE 2026-02-07. SKILL.md 1,079 lines (+469), error tolerance + ambiguity detection + confidence scoring
- [x] **Phase 24: Supervisor Agent** -- COMPLETE 2026-02-07. Supervisor agent at .claude/agents/supervisor.md (383 lines), skill/supervisor/SKILL.md (678 lines), CASE-PROGRESS.md checkpoint writing
- [x] **Phase 25: Diagnostic Specialist** -- COMPLETE 2026-02-07. skill/diagnostic/SKILL.md (1,874 lines), .claude/agents/diagnostic-specialist.md (455 lines), supervisor integration
- [x] **Phase 26: Thin Tools** -- COMPLETE 2026-02-08. MCP removed, CLI thinned, intelligence in skills, Ibuprofen CASE validated

---

### Phase 20: System Audit
**Goal**: Every CLI command, MCP tool, and skill section classified by intelligence level with a concrete migration recommendation
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v2.0)
**Requirements**: AUDT-01, AUDT-02, AUDT-03, AUDT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All 16 MCP tools classified as Tier 1 (keep), Tier 2 (migrate strategy to skill), or Tier 3 (refactor to thin wrapper)
  2. All 7 CLI command groups classified with recommendation for what intelligence stays vs moves to skill
  3. CLAUDE.md sections catalogued with duplication and misplacement identified
  4. Audit report exists with specific, actionable recommendation per component (not generic "simplify later")
**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:
- [x] 20-01-PLAN.md -- Audit MCP tools and CLI commands (tier classification)
- [x] 20-02-PLAN.md -- Audit CLAUDE.md (duplication and misplacement analysis)
- [x] 20-03-PLAN.md -- Compile final audit report with migration roadmap

---

### Phase 21: Skill Restructure
**Goal**: CASE workflow knowledge lives in a dedicated skill document separate from project-level instructions, with no duplication between documents
**Depends on**: Phase 20 (audit identifies what goes where)
**Requirements**: SKIL-01, SKIL-02, SKIL-03, SKIL-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. CLAUDE.md contains only project-level content (setup, database, developer reference, quick reference) and is under 800 lines
  2. SKILL.md contains the full CASE workflow (dereplication through ranking) with checkpoint markers for supervisor monitoring
  3. SUPERVISOR.md exists with loop detection patterns, intervention strategies, and escalation criteria
  4. No paragraph of domain knowledge appears in more than one document
**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:
- [x] 21-01-PLAN.md -- Write canonical skill/SKILL.md with deduplicated CASE domain knowledge (~500 lines)
- [x] 21-02-PLAN.md -- Trim CLAUDE.md to project-level content (~298 lines) and create supervisor skill
- [x] 21-03-PLAN.md -- Update subskills to remove duplication and verify zero cross-document duplication

---

### Phase 22: HMBC Strategy and Spectral Quality
**Goal**: The CASE skill teaches an incremental constraint strategy and spectral quality awareness so the AI agent builds LSD files in phases rather than dumping all correlations at once
**Depends on**: Phase 21 (needs SKILL.md to add content to)
**Requirements**: HMBC-01, HMBC-02, HMBC-03, HMBC-04, QUAL-01, QUAL-02, QUAL-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. SKILL.md contains a 3-phase HMBC constraint addition strategy (core structure from high-confidence signals, resolve ambiguity with diagnostic correlations, refine with full constraint set)
  2. SKILL.md explicitly states "start with 5-10 high-confidence HMBC correlations" and the decision tree for when to add more vs investigate failures
  3. SKILL.md explicitly prohibits the "use all correlations from peak picking" approach
  4. SKILL.md contains spectral quality assessment section covering S/N evaluation, digital resolution impact on close carbons, and artifact recognition (1J correlations, t1 noise, baseline roll)
  5. An AI agent reading SKILL.md would know to assess spectrum quality BEFORE picking peaks and to adjust expectations based on quality findings
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 22-01-PLAN.md -- Add Spectral Quality Assessment + Incremental HMBC Strategy to SKILL.md, update CASE Workflow and Quick Reference

---

### Phase 23: Error Tolerance and Confidence
**Goal**: The CASE skill teaches proactive error detection and requires confidence-annotated output so the AI agent documents ambiguity instead of guessing
**Depends on**: Phase 21 (needs SKILL.md to add content to)
**Requirements**: ETOL-01, ETOL-02, ETOL-03, ETOL-04, CONF-01, CONF-02, CONF-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. SKILL.md teaches close carbon shift detection -- AI identifies carbons within 0.3-0.5 ppm and documents the ambiguity before building LSD constraints
  2. SKILL.md teaches DEPT phase conflict handling -- AI compares HSQC vs DEPT multiplicities and chooses ground truth with documented reasoning
  3. SKILL.md teaches ambiguous HMBC assignment -- AI generates LSD variants when carbon positions are close (<1 ppm) rather than picking one arbitrarily
  4. SKILL.md teaches quaternary carbon HMBC sparsity -- AI uses chemical shift to constrain heteroatom attachment when few HMBC correlations are visible
  5. CASE workflow produces assignments with confidence levels (High >90%, Medium 60-90%, Low <60%) and explicitly flags where additional NMR experiments might help
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 23-01-PLAN.md -- Add Error Tolerance and Ambiguity Detection section to SKILL.md (close carbons, DEPT/HSQC conflicts, quaternary HMBC sparsity)
- [x] 23-02-PLAN.md -- Add Confidence Scoring section and integrate into CASE Workflow and Quick Reference

---

### Phase 24: Supervisor Agent
**Goal**: A supervisor agent can detect when the CASE agent is stuck in an unproductive loop and intervene with a specific diagnosis-first redirect
**Depends on**: Phase 21 (needs SUPERVISOR.md as knowledge source)
**Requirements**: SUPV-01, SUPV-02, SUPV-03, SUPV-04, SUPV-05, SUPV-06, SUPV-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Supervisor agent is defined as a Claude Code subagent (markdown file with YAML frontmatter in `.claude/agents/`)
  2. Supervisor detects ELIM thrashing -- adding ELIM repeatedly without diagnosing root cause triggers intervention
  3. Supervisor detects zero-solution loops -- 3+ attempts with 0 solutions and same approach triggers redirect
  4. Supervisor detects solution explosion -- 1000+ solutions with minor tweaks not reducing count triggers redirect
  5. Every supervisor intervention requires diagnosis before allowing retry (not generic "try again" -- specific like "validate sp2 count before trying ELIM")
  6. Supervisor escalates to user after 3 failed attempts with the same detected pattern
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 24-01-PLAN.md -- Expand supervisor SKILL.md with loop detection, diagnostics, convergence, CASE-PROGRESS.md format + update CASE subskill with checkpoint writing
- [x] 24-02-PLAN.md -- Create .claude/agents/supervisor.md agent definition with routing, supervision, and intervention logic

---

### Phase 25: Diagnostic Specialist
**Goal**: A diagnostic specialist agent can systematically determine WHY LSD failed and produce a structured report with root cause and recommended fixes
**Depends on**: Phase 24 (needs supervisor pattern validated; specialist uses same subagent mechanism)
**Requirements**: DIAG-01, DIAG-02, DIAG-03, DIAG-04, DIAG-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Diagnostic specialist is defined as a Claude Code subagent with deep LSD manual knowledge (MULT, HSQC, HMBC, BOND, LIST, PROP, ELEM, SYME, DEFF, ELIM)
  2. For 0-solution failures: specialist systematically checks sp2 count (even?), hydrogen budget (matches formula?), HMBC conflicts, and correlation order -- and reports which check failed
  3. For 1000+ solution failures: specialist checks constraint count, quaternary carbon connectivity, heteroatom constraints, and symmetry encoding -- and reports which is insufficient
  4. Specialist produces a structured diagnostic report (markdown) with findings, root cause, and recommended fixes that the CASE agent can act on
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 25-01-PLAN.md -- Create diagnostic specialist skill (skill/diagnostic/SKILL.md) and agent definition (.claude/agents/diagnostic-specialist.md)
- [x] 25-02-PLAN.md -- Update supervisor agent and skill to integrate diagnostic specialist delegation

---

### Phase 26: Thin Tools
**Goal**: MCP removed entirely, CLI commands are thin data-access wrappers, AI agent is sole intelligence layer using skill documents for all reasoning
**Depends on**: Phases 22, 23, 24 (skill content must encode the intelligence being removed from tools; multi-agent validated)
**Requirements**: TOOL-01, TOOL-02, TOOL-03, TOOL-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. MCP server removed entirely -- no src/lucy_ng/mcp/, no lucy-mcp entry point
  2. CLI commands are thin data-access wrappers -- pick hsqc/hmbc return raw peaks, analyze symmetry returns raw counts, lsd generate removed
  3. Intelligence previously in Python documented in SKILL.md as AI-executable strategy
  4. AI agent using thin CLI + SKILL.md solves Ibuprofen de novo CASE with correct structure in top 3
**Plans**: 5 plans
Plans:
- [x] 26-01-PLAN.md -- Remove MCP server entirely and clean up pyproject.toml
- [x] 26-02-PLAN.md -- Thin Tier 3 CLI commands (pick hsqc/hmbc raw, remove lsd generate, thin analyze symmetry)
- [x] 26-03-PLAN.md -- Consolidate duplicated code (database finder, LSD parser)
- [x] 26-04-PLAN.md -- Update CLAUDE.md, skill files, and agent definitions for CLI-only architecture
- [x] 26-05-PLAN.md -- Validate Ibuprofen de novo CASE with thin CLI + skill knowledge

</details>

## v2.1 Working Multi-Agent CASE (Phases 27-33)

**Milestone Goal:** Make multi-agent CASE orchestration actually work by implementing Claude Code's native orchestration primitives correctly, replacing v2.0's paper-only architecture with working sub-command skills that spawn agents, monitor progress, detect loops, and intervene autonomously.

**Core shift:** Supervisor logic dissolves from separate agent (supervisor.md) into orchestrator sub-command skill (case.md). Skills become entry points that spawn worker agents with inlined domain knowledge. Validation-first development prevents repeating v2.0's paper architecture mistake.

**Phase overview:**

- [x] **Phase 27: Sub-Command Skills Foundation** -- COMPLETE 2026-02-08. ~/.claude/commands/lucy-ng/ with 4 files (status, dereplicate, predict, routing page)
- [x] **Phase 28: CASE Agent Definition** -- COMPLETE 2026-02-08. ~/.claude/agents/lucy-case-agent.md (613 lines, 528 inlined knowledge, all 5 CASE reqs validated)
- [x] **Phase 29: CASE Orchestrator Skill** -- COMPLETE 2026-02-08. ~/.claude/commands/lucy-ng/case.md (622 lines, 9 requirements, 12-step orchestration)
- [ ] **Phase 30: Diagnostic Specialist Integration** -- Deep diagnosis after 2 failed basic interventions
- [ ] **Phase 31: Sanitization Skill** -- AI-driven dataset sanitization (no CLI)
- [ ] **Phase 32: End-to-End Validation** -- Minimum 10 integration tests, Ibuprofen CASE via orchestrator
- [ ] **Phase 33: Documentation and Cleanup** -- Delete supervisor.md, update docs, release notes

---

### Phase 27: Sub-Command Skills Foundation
**Goal**: Simple sub-command skills work and validate the GSD pattern before complex orchestration
**Depends on**: Phase 26 (thin CLI validated)
**Requirements**: SCMD-01, SCMD-04, SCMD-05, SCMD-06, SCMD-07

  3. /lucy-ng:dereplicate wraps `lucy dereplicate c13` and returns top matches with scores
  4. /lucy-ng:predict wraps `lucy predict c13` and returns shift predictions with confidence
  5. Old monolithic /lucy-ng skill replaced with routing page listing all sub-commands

**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 27-01-PLAN.md -- Create directory, status.md, and dereplicate.md skills
- [x] 27-02-PLAN.md -- Create predict.md skill and routing page

---

**Depends on**: Phase 27 (foundation validated)
**Requirements**: CASE-01, CASE-02, CASE-03, CASE-04, CASE-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Agent definition at ~/.claude/agents/lucy-case-agent.md with valid YAML frontmatter (name, description, tools: Read + Write + Bash + Glob + Grep)
  2. Agent receives inlined skill content (NMR background, CASE workflow, LSD basics) approximately 500-700 lines plus file path references for detailed knowledge
  3. Agent executes CASE workflow and writes CASE-PROGRESS.md after every LSD iteration with required fields (solution count, constraints added/removed, reasoning, confidence, sp2/H checks)
  4. Agent never attempts dereplication (absolute workflow separation validated)
  5. Integration test passes: spawn agent with minimal task, verify CASE-PROGRESS.md created with expected structure

**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 28-01-PLAN.md -- Create lucy-case-agent.md with YAML frontmatter, inlined skill knowledge, workflow, and progress format; validate against all 5 CASE requirements

---

### Phase 29: CASE Orchestrator Skill

**Requirements**: SCMD-02, ORCH-01, ORCH-02, ORCH-03, ORCH-04, ORCH-05, ORCH-06, ORCH-07, ORCH-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Skill file at ~/.claude/commands/lucy-ng/case.md spawns lucy-case-agent via Task() with hybrid context inlining (critical workflow inlined, detailed references via file paths)
  2. Orchestrator reads CASE-PROGRESS.md after agent completes and successfully parses solution count, constraints, reasoning
  3. Orchestrator detects ELIM thrashing (ELIM added 2+ times), zero-solution loop (3+ iterations with 0 solutions), solution explosion (3+ iterations >100 solutions <10% reduction), constraint churning (5+ iterations high add/remove activity)
  4. Orchestrator performs basic diagnosis (sp2 count even, H budget matches formula, 1J artifacts within tolerance) before intervention
  5. Orchestrator generates advisory interventions (WHAT to fix, not HOW) -- never prescribes specific LSD file edits
  6. Orchestrator tracks intervention counts separately per pattern (not global counter)
  7. Orchestrator escalates to user after 10 failed intervention cycles per pattern
  8. Orchestrator re-spawns agent with advisory constraints and skip-completed-work instructions in handoff

---

### Phase 30: Diagnostic Specialist Integration
**Goal**: Deep LSD failure analysis delegated to specialist after basic interventions fail
**Depends on**: Phase 29 (orchestrator working)
**Requirements**: DIAG-06, DIAG-07, DIAG-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Agent definition renamed from ~/.claude/agents/diagnostic-specialist.md to ~/.claude/agents/lucy-diagnostic.md with updated frontmatter (agent name matches new file)
  2. Orchestrator delegates to diagnostic specialist after 2 failed interventions with same loop pattern
  3. Orchestrator reads DIAGNOSTIC-REPORT.md, extracts root cause and primary fix, and includes in CASE agent advisory on next spawn
  4. Integration test passes: force repeated zero-solution failure, verify specialist spawned after 2 basic intervention failures, DIAGNOSTIC-REPORT.md created with systematic check results

**Plans**: TBD

---

### Phase 31: Sanitization Skill
**Goal**: AI-driven compound identifier removal for blind dataset evaluation
**Depends on**: Phase 27 (independent from orchestration)
**Requirements**: SCMD-03, SANT-01, SANT-02, SANT-03, SANT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Skill file at ~/.claude/commands/lucy-ng/sanitise.md with explicit statement: "There is NO CLI command for sanitization -- this requires AI semantic reasoning"
  2. AI detects compound identifiers: chemical names (IUPAC, common), SMILES strings, InChI/InChIKey, CAS numbers, MOL file structures, dataset naming patterns (e.g., "Ibuprofen_HSQC")
  3. AI generates redaction manifest and applies bulk sanitization using existing helper scripts (lucy_text_extractor.py, lucy_bulk_sanitize.py)
  4. Skill verifies completeness by re-extracting text and confirming no identifiers remain

**Plans**: TBD

---

### Phase 32: End-to-End Validation
**Goal**: All orchestration components validated through comprehensive integration tests before milestone ships
**Depends on**: Phases 29, 30, 31 (all features complete)
**Requirements**: VALD-01, VALD-02, VALD-03, VALD-04, VALD-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Integration test passes: orchestrator spawns CASE agent, agent writes CASE-PROGRESS.md, orchestrator reads and parses progress
  2. Loop detection test passes: construct known failure patterns (force ELIM thrashing, force zero solutions, force explosion), verify orchestrator detects and intervenes
  3. Diagnostic delegation test passes: repeated failures with same pattern trigger specialist spawn, DIAGNOSTIC-REPORT.md generated and consumed by orchestrator
  4. Ibuprofen CASE passes via /lucy-ng:case -- reproduces Phase 26-05 success through full orchestration (spawn → monitor → detect → intervene if needed → converge to correct structure in top 3)
  5. All simple sub-commands work: /lucy-ng:dereplicate returns matches, /lucy-ng:predict returns shifts, /lucy-ng:status reports system readiness

**Plans**: TBD

---

### Phase 33: Documentation and Cleanup
